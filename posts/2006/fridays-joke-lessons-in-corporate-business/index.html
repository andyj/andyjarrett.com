Happy Easter everyone<br/><br/><h3>Corporate Lesson 1:</h3><p>A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower,when the doorbell rings.</p><p>The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, "I'll give you $800 to drop that towel,"</p><p>After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.</p><p>When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, "Who was that?"</p> <p>"It was Bob the next door neighbour," she replies.</p><p>"Great!" the husband says, "did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?"</p><p>Moral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.</p><h3>Corporate Lesson 2:</h3><p>A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg.</p><p>The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"</p><p>The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"</p><p>The priest apologized "Sorry sister but the flesh is weak."</p><p>Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129.</p><p>It said, "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."</p><p>Moral of the story: If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.</p><h3>Corporate Lesson 3:</h3><p>A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out.</p><p>The Genie says, "I'll give each of you just one wish." "Me first! Me first!" says the admin. clerk.</p><p>"I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world." Poof! She's gone.</p><p>"Me next! Me next!" says the sales rep. "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life."<br>Poof! He's gone.</p><p>"OK, you're up," the Genie says to the manager.</p><p>The manager says, "I want those two back in the office after lunch."</p><p>Moral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.</p><h3>Corporate Lesson 4:</h3><p>A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him,<br> "Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?"</p><p>The crow answered: "Sure, why not."</p><p>So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.</p><p>A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.</p><p>Moral of the story: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up.</p><h3>Corporate Lesson 5:</h3><p>A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to Get to the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, but I haven't got the energy."</p><p>"Well, why don't you nibble on my droppings?" replied the bull.<br>"They're packed with nutrients."</p><p>The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.</p><p>The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.</p><p>Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree.</p><p>Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.</p><p>Moral of the story: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.</p><br>
