    <h1 class="mt-5 mb-5"><b>Fridays Joke- The swanky masked halloween party</b></h1>
    <main class="mw fw-lighter fs-5">
      
It's Friday and i'm back to the old style of <a href=""http://www.blogcfc.com>BlogCFC</a> to be retro kewl! Actually there's a couple of reason for this; 1. The last layout wasn't working with Safari (thanks <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk">Mark</a> for the shout) and 2. Something seems to be wrong with getting the blog stats page to work. Though this is still happening now so i'll have to look into that later ... odd. Have a good weekend!<p>A couple was invited to a swanky masked Halloween Party. She got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went.</p><p>The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakenedwithout pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.</p> <p>She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived.</p><p>She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had a little bang.</p><p>Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.</p><p>She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked whatkind of a time he had. He said, "Oh, the same old thing. Youknow I never have a good time when you're not there."</p><p>Then she asked, "Did you dance much?"</p><p>He replied, "You know I don't ever dance I just make a fool of myself. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you... the guy I loaned my costume to sure had a real good time!" </p><br>
