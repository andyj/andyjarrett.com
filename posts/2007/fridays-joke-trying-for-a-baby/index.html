    <main class="mw fw-lighter fs-5">
      
No Joke next Friday! Sorry people but its that time for me to leave the county on Sunday morning and head somewhere hot. That somewhere is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> again. We really enjoyed it last year so we are gonna go to the east coast, about an hour south of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancun">Cancun</a> one more time before we try somewhere different in the world. <p>The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family.</p><p>On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, "Well, I'm off now; The man should be here soon."</p><p>Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.</p><p>Good morning, Ma'am", he said, "I've come to...''</p><p>Oh, no need to explain," Mrs . Smith cut in, embarrassed, "I've been expecting you."</p> <p>"Have you really?" said the photographer. "Well, that's good.  Did you know babies are my specialty?"</p><p>"Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat"</p><p>After a moment she asked, blushing, "Well, where do we start?"</p><p>"Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there."</p><p>"Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!"<br/>"Well, M a'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results."</p><p>"My, that's a lot!" gasped Mrs. Smith.</p><p>"Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes,but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that."</p><p>"Don't I know it," said Mrs. Smith quietly.</p><p>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. "This was done on the top of a bus," he said.</p><p>"Oh my God!" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.</p><p>"And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with."</p><p>"She was difficult?" asked Mrs. Smith.</p><p>"Yes, I'm afraid so I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look."</p><p>"Four and five deep?" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.</p><p>"Yes", the photographer replied. "And for more than three hours, too.</p><p>The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots.</p><p>Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in."</p><p>Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh...equipment?"</p><p>"It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away."</p><p>"Tripod?" Mrs. Jacobs looked extremely worried now. </p><p>"Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long."<br/>"Ma'am...ma'am...good God, she's fainted!'"</p><br>
